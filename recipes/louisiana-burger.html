        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine ground beef, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, seasoning salt, Louisiana hot sauce, and one whole egg</li>
            <li>Mix all ingredients until evenly blended</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture up into however many burgers you want to make, and flatten the pieces into the shape of a burger patty</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a cast iron skillet and heat to a medium-high heat</li>
            <li>Add patties to the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side</li>
            <li>While burgers are cooking, slice the tomato and purple onions to desired thickness</li>
            <li>For the last 30 seconds of cook time, add cheese to the patties and cover the skillet to ensure an even melting of cheese to the patties</li>
            <li>Remove the cooked patties from the skillet and set aside to rest</li>
            <li>While the patties are resting, lightly butter the top and bottom bun and place inside the skillet to toast the bun</li>
            <li>After the buns are toasted, assemble the burger</li>
            <li>Add a thin layer of mayonnaise and mustard to the top and bottom bun, spreading evenly with a butter knife</li>
            <li>Add lettuce to the bottom bun</li>
            <li>Next, add the sliced onion and pickles on top of the lettuce</li>
            <li>Place the burger patty with melted cheese on top of the onion and pickles</li>
            <li>Next, place the sliced tomato on top of the patty</li>
            <li>Finally, place the top bun on the burger</li>
