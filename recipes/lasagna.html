        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>

        <li>1 (8ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly; 5-7 minutes</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8-10 minutes. Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F</li>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined</li>
        <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauceover the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to coat it. Place 2 layers of noodles over the sauce to cover</li>
        <li>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5-10 more minutes</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving</li>
    </ol>
